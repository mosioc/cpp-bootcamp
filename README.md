# C++ Bootcamp Repository

This repository contains various C++ projects, exercises, and slides that I worked on during the bootcamp or were provided to us by the organizer ([Saeed Amrollahi Boyouki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saeed-amrollahi-boyouki/)).
Each folder corresponds to a different module or project from the bootcamp, with individual files containing source code, instructions, and exercises.

## Getting Started

To get started with the files in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mosioc/cpp-bootcamp.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the cloned directory:**

    ```bash
    cd cpp-bootcamp
    ```

3. **Explore the modules and projects:**

    Navigate into any module or project folder to view the source code and README files for instructions.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run the C++ programs in this repository, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. Here are some common options:

- **g++ (GNU Compiler Collection):** Available on most Unix-based systems including Linux and macOS.
- **Clang:** Another popular compiler for Unix-based systems.
- **Microsoft Visual C++:** Available for Windows users.

## Usage

To compile and run a C++ file, follow these general steps:

1. **Navigate to the directory containing the source file:**

    ```bash
    cd "Source Code"
    ```

2. **Compile one of the C++ file:**

    ```bash
    g++ -o hello_world hello_world.cpp
    ```

3. **Run the compiled program:**

    ```bash
    ./hello_world
    ```
